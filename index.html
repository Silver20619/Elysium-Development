                <h3>Early-January: Revamping of Original Concept</h3>
                <p>Previously, the world of Elysium was designed with a closed-concept in mind, but now, we've fully transferred to an open-expansive world for you and your friends to explore. This open world is planned to include multiple regions on launch as well as secret dungeons for you to explore!</p>
